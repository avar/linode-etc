# This is the Debian-specific qpsmtpd rcpthosts setting, containing the list of
# host and domain names for which qpsmtpd will accept mail.  It should include
# all locally-delivered domain names as well as those for which you wish to
# relay mail.  This file was generated by debconf when qpsmtpd was installed or
# (re)configured.  To alter it, please run 'dpkg-reconfigure qpsmtpd'.  If you
# prefer to edit the rcpthosts list manually, edit /etc/qpstmpd/rcpthosts and
# remove the $include reference to this file.
